Hello world !!!
This was my second project in Codecademy, where i created the console game Tic-Tac-Toe or also names as Noughts and Crosses, using C++. I was using Visual Studio for coding.
If you have any suggestions - let me know. I want to know where can i code better, more compact and if there are any mistakes. 
Welcome and have fun !
